# URL Shorting website with API

Demo view ->[here](https://url-shorting-rengo.netlify.app).

 I used React JS to build a URL shortening website project that used a REST API and was built using React JS and Tailwind CSS. The goal of the project was to create a simple and user-friendly website that allowed users to input a long URL and receive a shortened URL in return.
